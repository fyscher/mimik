# Mimik Base Tree / Distribution

Mimik base tree / distribution is a implementation of a POSIX-Like operating system, as well as many other free to use data. All under the same license and with the same goal.


## Goal

The goal of mimik is to provide a completely free, and open, collection of everything someone would have on their computer. All of this work is designed to be objective, easy to use, for the user, and conforming to open source ideals. Compatibility with existing standards will hold, but new mimik created standards are preferred.
